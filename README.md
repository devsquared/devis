# devis
This is my personal cli tool that I pack all of my common workflows into.

## Currently working on...
- note - implementation done!
    - add clear and clean logging and better error handling
    - test the things please...

## Ideas
- create reminders and TODOs - some kind of local storage
    - utilize colors and such for priorities
    - would be cool to show top3 things in list with every response to a command
- get a list of things on my schedule

## Scratch Thoughts
- **as soon as we need a config file for anything, create a utility to generate config file**
- utilize cfg build stuff for different OSs
- utilize indicatif (or others) crate for progress bars and such
- utilize clap-verbosity-flag crate for quick implementation of verbosity flag

## devcontainer
that is used so i can actually develop on a windows machine utilizing vscode
