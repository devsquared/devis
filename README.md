# devis
This is my personal cli tool that I pack all of my common workflows into.

## Currently working on...
- note it - create a markdown file

## Ideas
- get a list of things on my schedule

## Scratch Thoughts
- **as soon as we need a config file for anything, create a utility to generate config file**
- utilize indicatif (or others) crate for progress bars and such
- utilize clap-verbosity-flag crate for quick implementation of verbosity flag

## devcontainer
that is used so i can actually develop on a windows machine utilizing vscode
